                        <a href={"https://www.vexrobotics.com/"}>VEX Robotics</a> is an educational program that
                        encourages students to explore STEM fields through
                        hands-on robotics challenges. Every year, VEX hosts competitions where teams can compete in
                        regional events across the US and a World Championship. VEX-U is the college-level division of
                        VEX Robotics, where students can compete in a more advanced and challenging environment.

                        We work with
                        industry-standard tools and software to create robots that can complete a variety of tasks.
                        This includes designing parts in CAD software, 3D-printing prototypes, assembling the robot,
                        and programming the robot to move autonomously.
                        We also work on outreach projects to help promote STEM education among the UW-Stout community.

                        This season in <a href={"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvDqEI7qO34"}>VEX Over Under</a>, we
                        are designing a robot to collect and score triangular balls into nets on either side of the
                        field, as well as to hang from a bar at the end of the match. Whoever scores the most points
                        at the end of the match, wins!
