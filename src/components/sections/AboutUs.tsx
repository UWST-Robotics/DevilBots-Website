                        We are UW-Stoutâ€™s Robotics Team
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        We work with
                        industry-standard tools and software to construct robots to can complete a variety of goals and
                        tasks.
                        This includes designing parts in CAD software, 3D-printing prototypes, assembling the robot,
                        and programming autonomous routines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also work on a variety of different outreach projects to help promote STEM education among
                        the UW-Stout community.
                        This includes hosting workshops, attending events, and working with local schools to help teach
                        students about robotics.
